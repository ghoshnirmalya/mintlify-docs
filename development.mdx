<Info>
  **Prerequisite** You should have installed Node.js (version 18.10.0 or
  higher).
</Info>

Step 1. Install Mintlify on your OS:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify
```

```bash yarn
yarn global add mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

Step 2. Go to the docs are located (where you can find `mint.json`) and run the following command:

```bash
mintlify dev
```

The documentation website is now available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Custom Ports

Mintlify uses port 3000 by default. You can use the `--port` flag to customize the port Mintlify runs on. For example, use this command to run in port 3333:

```bash
mintlify dev --port 3333
```

You will see an error like this if you try to run Mintlify in a port that's already taken:

```md
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000
```

## Mintlify Versions

Each CLI is linked to a specific version of Mintlify. Please update the CLI if your local website looks different than production.

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify@latest
```

```bash yarn
yarn global upgrade mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

## Deployment

<Tip>
  Unlimited editors available under the [Startup
  Plan](https://mintlify.com/pricing)

  <Tab title="ABC">

    Consider the following list of events:

    | Event         | Amount | Total number of events         | Total amount       | Result     |
    | ------------- | ------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------ | ---------- |
    | Transaction 1 | \$200  | 1 free event (out of 3)        | \$200 (\$500 free) | No charges |
    | Transaction 2 | \$100  | 2 free events (out of 3)       | \$300 (\$500 free) | No charges |
    | Transaction 3 | \$100  | 3 free events (out of 3)       | \$400 (\$500 free) | No charges |
    | Transaction 4 | \$50   | 4 events (free units exceeded) | \$450 (\$500 free) | Charge     |

    Therefore, for the fourth transaction, the charge will be \$0.10 x 1 event + 1.2%
    of \$50 = \$0.70.

      | Tier   | First unit | Last unit | Unit price | Fixed fee  |
      | ------ | ---------- | --------- | ---------- | ---------- |
      | Tier 1 | 0          | 10,000    | \$0.0010   | \$10       |
      | Tier 2 | 10,001     | 50,000    | \$0.0008   | \$10       |
      | Tier 3 | 50,001     | 100,000   | \$0.0006   | \$10       |
      | Tier 4 | 100,001    | ∞         | \$0.0004   | \$10       |

      In this case, 65,000 API calls would cost 65,000 x \$0.0006 + \$10 = \$49.
