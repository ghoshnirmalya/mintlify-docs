## Overview of charges[](#overview-of-charges "Direct link to heading")

To incorporate usage-based charges into a plan, you can utilize existing billable metrics.
This enables you to offer "pay-as-you-go" features.
For instance, you can create charges based on the number of API calls, the
number of active users, transactions, compute time, etc. These additional
charges relate to the [billable metrics](/guide/billable-metrics/create-billable-metrics) defined previously.
Here are some important details to consider regarding usage-based charges:

### Currency of charges[](#charges-currency "Direct link to heading")

All charges are denominated in the same currency as the plan to ensure consistency and transparency.

### Trial period exclusions[](#trial-period-exclusion "Direct link to heading")

It's important to note that the trial period exclusively applies to the base amount of the plan and does not extend
to usage-based charges.

## Number of decimals[](#number-of-decimals "Direct link to heading")

Lago allows you create charges with up to fifteen decimals (e.g.
\$0.000123456789123).

Please note that charges are invoiced in `amount_cents`. Therefore, Lago
automatically rounds prices (e.g. USD 1102 `amount_cents` \= \$11.02).

## Metered vs Recurring charges[](#metered-recurring "Direct link to heading")

You have the flexibility to define the nature of charges associated with your products or services. Specifically, you can
**determine whether a charge is metered or recurring**. Understanding the distinction between these two types of charges is crucial for
effectively managing your billing processes. In this documentation, we will delve into the differences between metered and
recurring charges and their implications within the Lago system.

### 1. Metered charges[](#metered "Direct link to heading")

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Dashboard">
  When you create a metered billable metric in Lago by setting the `recurring` parameter to `false`, an important behavior comes into play.
  At the end of each billing period, the accumulated number of units associated with the metric is automatically reset to 0.
  This means that the counting or measuring of units starts fresh with each new billing cycle. This is ideal for billing components with results
  that are not persisted billing periods over billing periods.

In the API tab beside, consider the example of a **Storage billing unit**. If you need to **track the Gigabytes stored during a month**,
it's important to note that this value should be reset to 0 at the beginning of each new month.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="API">
    Create a billable metric with `recurring` sets to `false`.

            "description": "GB of storage used in my application",

            }
          }
        }'
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 2. Recurring charges[](#recurring "Direct link to heading")

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Dashboard">
  When you create a recurring billable metric in Lago with the recurring parameter set to true, an important behavior comes
  into effect. At the end of each billing period, the accumulated number of units calculated from the previous billing period is
  carried forward to the next billing period.

This means that the counting or measurement of units starts based on the last recorded value from the previous billing cycle.
This behavior is particularly useful for billing components or services where the results need to persist from one billing period
to another.

In the API tab, let's consider the example of a **Seats billing unit**. If you need to **track the number of active seats**, it's crucial to
note that this value should persist month over month. The recurring billing behavior ensures that the count of active seats is
maintained and carried forward to subsequent billing periods, providing accurate and continuous tracking of your subscription seats.

## In-arrears vs In-advance charges[](#advance-arrears "Direct link to heading")

### 1. Charges paid in arrears[](#charges-arrears "Direct link to heading")

If you opt for charges to be settled in arrears, they will be invoiced at the end of the billing period based on
the actual usage during that period. This payment option is ideal for usage types like storage, API calls, or compute,
where it is more practical to wait until the end of the period before billing. By default, all charges are configured to be
billed in arrears.

## Available charge models[](#charge-models "Direct link to heading")

Here is the full list of usage-based charges pricing models provided by Lago.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Standard">
    Select the standard charge model if you want to charge the **same price for each
    unit** consumed.

    Imagine that your API company charges \$0.05 per API call (i.e. your billable
    metric). By selecting the standard charge model, you will define a fixed unit
    price. If a customer makes 1,000 API calls during the billing period, the total
    invoice amount will be \$0.05 x 1,000 API calls = \$50.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Graduated">
    Select the graduated charge model if you want to define **several price tiers**.
    This charge model allows you to apply a discount depending on the number of
    units consumed. You can also apply a **flat fee** to an entire tier.

    Let's take back the example of the API company. You could charge \$1 per unit for
    the first 100 units (first 100 API calls), then \$0.50 per unit for the next 100
    calls and finally, \$0.10 for any additional unit.

    Please refer to the tooltip in the user interface for more information.

    <Frame caption="Configuration of the graduated charge model" >
      <img src="/guide/plans/images/graduated-charge-pricing-model-65dd3d428a7a5aaeb486e851adf029e7.png" />
    </Frame>

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Package">
    Select the package charge model if you want to apply a **fixed price to a range
    of units**. You also have the ability to offer free units.

    Let's take back the example of our API company. You may want to charge \$5 per
    100 units and offer the first 100 units. In this example, 201 units would cost
    \$0 (first 100 units) + \$5 (next 100 units) + \$5 (last unit) = \$10.

    <Frame  caption="Configuration of the package charge model" >
      <img src="/guide/plans/images/package-pricing-charge-model-ff1836a27a037aaf14819bbdb70c836b.png"/>
    </Frame>

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Percentage">
    Select the percentage charge model if you want to apply a **percentage and a
    fixed fee on transactions** (e.g. bank transfers, ATM withdrawals, etc.).

    This charge model is generally used with billable metrics that allow users to
    calculate the total amount of transactions (e.g. `sum` aggregation type and
    `amount` defined as the event property -
    [learn more](/guide/billable-metrics/aggregation-types)).

    You can define several parameters for the percentage charge model, including:

    - **Percentage rate**: charge rate that applies to the total amount (e.g. 1.2%
      on transactions);
    - **Fixed fee (optional)**: fee that applies to each event ingested during the
      billing period (e.g. \$0.10 per transaction);
    - **Free units (per event - optional)**: number of events that are not subject to
      the fixed fee;
    - **Free units (total amount - optional)**: amount that is not subject to the
      charge rate;
    - **Per-transaction spending minimum (per event - optional)**: sets the minimum amount of spending required for each individual transaction; and
    - **Per-transaction spending maximum (per event - optional)**: sets the maximum amount of spending required for each individual transaction.

    When free units are defined for both the total amount and number of events, Lago
    performs checks each time a new event is ingested to determine whether the free
    units still apply. In the illustration below for instance, the first 3 events or
    \$500 are free.

    <Info>**Premium feature ✨**: only users with a premium license can define a per-transaction spending minimum and maximum for the percentage pricing model.
    Please **[contact us](mailto:hello@getlago.com)** to get access to Lago Cloud and Lago Self-Hosted Premium.</Info>

    <Frame  caption="Configuration of the percentage charge model">
      <img src="/guide/plans/images/percentage-model-b2657bc04ac57c27cfe3bc3b830fd8dc.png"/>
    </Frame>

    Consider the following list of events:

    | Event         | Amount | Total number of events         | Total amount       | Result     |
    | ------------- | ------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------ | ---------- |
    | Transaction 1 | \$200  | 1 free event (out of 3)        | \$200 (\$500 free) | No charges |
    | Transaction 2 | \$100  | 2 free events (out of 3)       | \$300 (\$500 free) | No charges |
    | Transaction 3 | \$100  | 3 free events (out of 3)       | \$400 (\$500 free) | No charges |
    | Transaction 4 | \$50   | 4 events (free units exceeded) | \$450 (\$500 free) | Charge     |

    Therefore, for the fourth transaction, the charge will be \$0.10 x 1 event + 1.2%
    of \$50 = \$0.70.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Volume">
      Select the volume charge model if you want to define several price tiers but
      want to apply a **single unit price based on the total volume**. You can also
      apply a **flat fee** in addition to the unit price.

      Consider the following example, where each unit represents an API call:

      | Tier   | First unit | Last unit | Unit price | Fixed fee  |
      | ------ | ---------- | --------- | ---------- | ---------- |
      | Tier 1 | 0          | 10,000    | \$0.0010   | \$10       |
      | Tier 2 | 10,001     | 50,000    | \$0.0008   | \$10       |
      | Tier 3 | 50,001     | 100,000   | \$0.0006   | \$10       |
      | Tier 4 | 100,001    | ∞         | \$0.0004   | \$10       |

      In this case, 65,000 API calls would cost 65,000 x \$0.0006 + \$10 = \$49.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Graduated percentage">
      Select the graduated percentage model if you want to define several percentage tiers. You can also
      apply a **flat fee** per tier in addition to the rate.
      Note that the **rate** is the only mandatory value. It's particularly useful for fintech charging graduated rates for a feature.

      Consider the following example, where each unit represents an API call:

      | Tier   | First unit | Last unit | Rate       | Flat fee |
      | ------ | ---------- | --------- | ---------- | -------- |
      | Tier 1 | 0          | 1,000     | 1%         | \$200    |
      | Tier 2 | 1,001      | 10,000    | 2%         | \$300    |
      | Tier 3 | 10,001     | ∞         | 3%         | \$400    |

      A first transaction at \$500 would cost (500 units x 1%) + \$200 flat fee = \$205.00;
      A second transaction at \$550 would cost [(500 units x 1%)  + (50 units x 2%)] + \$300 flat fee = \$306.00;
      A third transaction at \$4,000 would cost (4,000 x 2%) = \$80.00.

      <Tip>
        Unlike the fixed fee, **the flat fee is applied to the entire tier**, rather than per transaction.

## Prorated vs fully-billed charges[](#prorated-fully "Direct link to heading")

You can **determine whether a charge is prorated or fully-billed**. Understanding the distinction between these two types of
charges is crucial for effectively managing your billing processes. In this documentation, we will delve into the differences
between prorated and fully-billed charges and their implications within the Lago system.

### 1. Prorated charges[](#prorated "Direct link to heading")

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Dashboard">
  <Warning>
    Only charges that are [recurring](#2-recurring-charges) (billable metric with `recurring` argument sets to `true`) with a `charge_model` defined to `standard` or `volume` can be prorated.
  </Warning>

When creating a prorated charge in Lago with the `prorated` parameter set to `true`, an important behavior is triggered.
Adding a new unit during the billing period results in the amount due for that unit being prorated based on the number of
days it was used.

This means that your customers will only be charged for the actual number of days they utilized a billing unit. Let's **consider
the example of prorated `Seats`**, where each seat costs \$10. If a new seat is added on June 10th, the unit will be prorated for 22 days, resulting in a corresponding prorated charge for that duration. This ensures fair and accurate billing based on the
usage period.

_Example: (1 Seat x \$10), used for 22 days = \$7.33_

By leveraging prorated charges in Lago, you can provide transparent and cost-effective billing for services that are added or
removed mid-billing cycle, adjusting the charges according to the actual duration of usage.

### 2. Fully-billed charges[](#fully-billed "Direct link to heading")

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Dashboard">
    <Warning>
      Note that metered charges (billable metrics with `recurring` sets to `false`) are automatically fully-billed.
    </Warning>

When creating a fully-billed charge in Lago with the `prorated` parameter set to `false`, an important behavior occurs.
If a new unit is added during the billing period, the amount due for that unit is billed in full, regardless of the number of
days it was used.

This means that your customers will be charged for the entire billing period, even if they only utilized the billing unit for a
few days. **Let's consider the example of fully-billed Seats**, where each seat costs \$10. If a new seat is added on June 10th, it will
be billed for the full billing period. For instance, if there is one seat that was used for 22 days in the billing period, the
charge would be calculated as follows:

_(1 Seat x \$10), used for 22 days = \$10._

By utilizing fully-billed charges in Lago, you ensure that you do not lose revenue by billing customers for the entire billing period,
regardless of the actual duration of usage.

## Charge spending minimum[](#charge-spending-minimum "Direct link to heading")

<Info>
  **Premium feature ✨**: only users with a premium license can define a charge
  spending minimum. Please **[contact us](mailto:hello@getlago.com)** to get
  access to Lago Cloud and Lago Self-Hosted Premium.
</Info>

Usage-based charges are always paid at the end of the billing period, based on the amount of consumption that occurred. However, you
could possibly need to define a spending minimum that a customer needs to commit to.

If your customer spends less than the committed amount, you will **charge a true-up fee equal to the difference between the commitment
and the actual usage**. Please note that this true-up fee is tied to the initial charge but will appear as a separate line item in an
invoice or in a credit note.

**Spending minimums and true-up fees are always prorated based on the number of days used in the subscription**. This ensures
fairness if your customer signs up at the end of the month, upgrades to a new plan, or terminates an ongoing subscription
before the end of the period.

In the example below, a customer is billed based on Monthly Tracked Users (MTU), with a standard pricing of \$0.010 per tracked users.
However, the customer is committed to a spending minimum of \$100. If the total consumption of MTUs for the period is \$50, a true-up fee
of \$50 will be charged.

To define a charge spending minimum:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Dashboard">
    1. Go to a **Plan**;
    2. Add a usage-based **charge**;
    3. Define a price model;
    4. Click the add a **spending minimum** button; and
    5. Define a spending minimum **amount**.

## Instant charges: not invoiceable[](#instant-charges "Direct link to heading")

<Info>
  **Premium feature ✨**: only users with a premium license can define whether
  or not a charge is invoiceable. Please **[contact
  us](mailto:hello@getlago.com)** to get access to Lago Cloud and Lago
  Self-Hosted Premium.
</Info>

If a charge needs to be `paid in advance`, you can choose whether or not it generates an invoice.

The `"invoiceable": false` option is **particularly relevant for fintech companies that want to charge customers instantly
without issuing an invoice**. This feature can be useful for banking transactions like ATM withdrawals, FX transfers and other
similar scenarios.

By setting the invoiceable parameter to false, you can streamline the payment process, eliminating the step of generating
invoices for these specific charges.

To define if a charge is invoiceable or not:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Dashboard">
    1. Go to a **Plan**;
    2. Add a usage-based **charge**;
    3. Define a price model;
    4. Define this charge as **paid in advance**; and
    5. Untick **generate an invoice for each event**.

## Delete a charge[](#delete-charge "Direct link to heading")

You may delete a charge included in a plan associated with existing
[subscriptions](/guide/subscriptions/assign-plan).

If you do so and save the change:

- The charge will be immediately removed from all subscriptions linked to this
  plan;
- The charge will no longer be included in the
  [current usage](/api-reference/customer-usage/customer-usage-object) of the customers
  concerned; and
- The charge will be immediately removed from all `draft` invoices associated
  with these subscriptions.

However, the charge will still be included in all `finalized` invoices
associated with these subscriptions.

<Info>
  Deleting a charge does not delete the events associated with the corresponding
  billable metric. If later you decide to add the charge back into the plan, the
  events received before the deletion may be taken into account in the billing
  process (depending on the limits of the billing period).
